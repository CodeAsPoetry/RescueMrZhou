黄沙里用竹笔写下的字叫勇气
Jay：You just have to try
To be who you are
And you ought to fly
Step into the light
小派：And soon you will find
Be yourself
Somewhere deep inside
There's a universe right 
there waiting to be unlocked
The key lies in looking into yourself
Jay：Oh Try try try try
Just do what is right
You'll fly so high
Let go of the brakes
Be who you are
Be yourself 'cause your power is on
合： When you believe in what you've got
You know you're perfect just be who you are
小派：So they don't see what you're made of
But I like you and I know
